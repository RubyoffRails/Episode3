Episode3: Watchman -- Datastores in YML and Postgres
====================================================

Storing data in Postgres, with migrations, outside of Rails

Your Assignment
---------------

1. Download and install PostgreSQL (see show notes)
2. Clone, fork this repo and copy the config/database.yml.sample to config/database.yml, edit with values

3. Create a table (using the migrations) which represents a hobby of yours: Fishing, Sports, Cooking, etc.
4. When I run ruby watchman.rb
	* Fill the table with 5 records (Recipe.create)
	* Have it show me all the records, with a nicely implemented to_s method
  * Ask me (the user) what I want to show. Example, if you have Recipe with :name and :ingredients:

```
[Recipes.all]
"Cornbread Muffins", [corn, butter, oil]
"Tacos", [tortilla, avacado, shrimp]

What would you like to learn more about?

#[editor: if I enter "Tacos" I'll see the Tacos recipe. If I enter nutella, I see "sorry Dave, I can't do that right now"]
```

Extra Credit
------------

1. Remove the delete_all statements from db/seed.rb, but don't grow the number of records each time
2. Add validation on your models

* Mac types can also: `brew install postgres` but the oneclick is very nice.
